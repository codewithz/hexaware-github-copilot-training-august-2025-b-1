# Find and fix a bug

## Introduction
This project contains a class called ValidateISBN which is used to validate ISBN numbers (the numbers that appear on the barcode on books.).

The class was written using Test driven development techniques, however there is a failing test and the developer cannot work out what is wrong.

## The challenge
* Using GenAI tools, find out what is wrong with the code and fix it.
* You should be able to explain why the code wasn't working and what differences the changes to the code make.
* Be sure to check that every change suggested by the GenAI tool is actually needed.
* In addition, review the code and identify any improvements that could be made. 
* Determine if the descriptions of the exceptions that could be thrown accurate.
* As you make any changes, use the tests to check that the code still works!
* You might also ask the GenAI tools to suggest additional tests that could be added to the test suite.
